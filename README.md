# C Text Processing Toolkit

## Overview üåê

**C Text Processing Toolkit** is a repository containing a collection of C programs designed for various text processing tasks. This toolkit currently includes two main programs: **Balanced Bracket Checker (BBC)** and **ASCII Sequence Compressor (ASC)**.

## Programs Included üìú

### 1. Balanced Bracket Checker (BBC)

- **Purpose**: Checks if brackets in the input text are correctly balanced.
- **Features**:
  - Validates `()`, `{}`, and `[]` brackets.
  - Skips brackets inside strings and comments.
  - Reports unbalanced lines and single curly braces.
- See [BBC/README.md](BBC/README.md) for more details.

### 2. ASCII Sequence Compressor (ASC)

- **Purpose**: Compresses sequences of consecutive ASCII characters.
- **Features**:
  - Detects and compresses sequences where each character's ASCII value is one greater than the previous character.
  - Compresses sequences longer than two characters into a start and end character, separated by a dash (`-`).
- See [ASC/README.md](ASC/README.md) for more details.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Compilation**:
   - Each program can be compiled using a C compiler like `gcc`.
   - Example for BBC:

     ```bash
     gcc -o bbc bbc.c
     ```

   - Example for ASC:

     ```bash
     gcc -o asc asc.c
     ```

2. **Execution**:
   - Run the compiled program in a terminal or command prompt.
   - For BBC:

     ```bash
     ./bbc
     ```

   - For ASC:

     ```bash
     ./asc
     ```

   - Follow on-screen instructions for each program.
